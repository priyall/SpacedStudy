<h2> SpacedStudy </h2>

A really important part about education that a lot of people miss out on is the environment and infrasrtructure.

SpacedStudy is a web application targeted towards students who dont have conducive environment at home to study in silence and without any distractions. The main purpose of SpacedStudy is to help students find distraction free places -- SpacedStudy -- near them, where they can go and study and have a distraction free zone. These SpacedStudy places will be local libraries and cafes approved by the team where anyone can go and be welcomed. 

This solves the problem that a lot of cafes dont allow students to sit for few hours without any distractions and free wifi. The cafes which partner with SpacedStudy will work on monthly fee basis which would be covered with premium membership benefits.
